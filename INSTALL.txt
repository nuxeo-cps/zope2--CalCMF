This software uses several innovative development paradigms. As a result it 
has rather overwhelming installation instructions. Sorry about that.

You will need:

* Zope 2.9.x. The last version as of this release is 2.9.2.

* CMF 1.5.6 or Plone 2.5.

The following requirements are usually included in the distribution, and
is recorded here for documentation purposes:

* CalCore 2.0.1.

* CalZope 2.3.0.

* iCalendar 0.11. 
   http://codespeak.net/icalendar/iCalendar-0.10.tgz

* CMFonFive 1.3.2


Intallation
===========
You must first install Zope and CMF or Plone. Then you download and install
the CalCMF bundle, called CalCMF-bundle-0.9.0-1.tgz. Extract it with 

  tar zvfx CalCMF-bundle-0.9.0-1.tgz

Move the files into your Zope instances Products directory:

  mv CalCMF-bundle-0.9.0/* <zope-instace-home>/Products

Restart Zope.

You can either install CalCMF with CMFQuickInstaller (included with Plone) 
or by createing an External Method, with the parameters:

  Module Name: CalZope.install
  Function Name: install

You then install the product by clicking on the Test-tab of the External Method.
